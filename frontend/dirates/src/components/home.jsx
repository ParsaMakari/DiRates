        <strong>DiRates</strong> is a student-built project with a noble (and
        slightly chaotic) mission:
        <br />
        To give UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al computer science students a place to{" "}
        <strong>share honest opinions</strong> about <strong>courses</strong>{" "}
        and <strong>professors</strong>â€”without needing to whisper in a hallway
        or decode mysterious Reddit threads.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're trying to pick the least soul-crushing 8AM course, avoid
        200-slide lectures from the 90s, or just want to know if "Algorithm
        Analysis" is as terrifying as it soundsâ€¦
        <br />
        You're in the right place.
      </p>

      <p>
        This platform was crafted <em>by UdeM students, for UdeM students</em>
        â€”so you can:
